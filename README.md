#Themes for Radium

Some themes I made for the [Radium DAW](https://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/)

To install, move whatever theme you want to the same folder of the file named "colors" in your radium instalation, then remove that file and remove the extension of the theme file, so the name become "colors"
